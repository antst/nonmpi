NONMPI 
======

aka sequantial/serial MPI library.

Although it looks strange on a first glance, 
but there is dozen of reasons why one would like 
to compile MPI code without using actual MPI library.

It is handy to have for this situations some stub and lightweight 
library which can be used for compilation and linking in such case.

Beware, this is project is on early stages of development and is not fully functional yet.
But a first goal is to provide complete MPI >= 1.2 realization with at least C and F77 intefaces.
