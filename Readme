NOMPI stub MPI library
----------------------

Although it looks strange on a first glance, 
but there is dozen of reasons why one would like 
to compile MPI code without using actual MPI library.

It is handy to have for this situations some stub and lightweight 
library which can be used for compilation and linking in such case.

Beware, this is project which just started, so nothing to test yet.
------------------------------------------------------------------

But a plan is to provide complete MPI >= 1.2 realization with at least C and F77 intefaces.
